    <h3>Who was Elizabeth Cady Stanton</h3>
    
    <p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton was an abolitionist, human rights activist and one of the first leaders of the woman’s rights movement. She came from a privileged background and decided early in life to fight for equal rights for women. Elizabeth worked closely with Susan B. Anthony—she was reportedly the brains behind Susan’s brawn—for over 50 years to win the women’s right to vote. Still, her activism was not without controversy, which kept Elizabeth on the fringe of the women’s suffrage movement later in life, though her efforts helped bring about the eventual passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave all citizens the right to vote.

    <h3>Her Childhood</h3>
    
    <p>Elizabeth was born in Johnstown, New York, on November 12, 1815, to Daniel Cady and Margaret Livingston. 
    <p>Elizabeth’s father was a slave owner, prominent attorney, Congressman and judge who exposed his daughter to the study of law and other so-called male domains early in her life. This exposure ignited a fire within Elizabeth to remedy laws unjust to women.

    <h3>Her Education</h3>
        <p>Elizabeth received her formal education at the Johnstown Academy and at Emma Willard's Troy Female Seminary in New York. Her father was a noted lawyer and state assemblyman and young Elizabeth gained an informal legal education by talking with him and listening in on his conversations with colleagues and guests.
    <p>When Elizabeth graduated from Johnstown Academy at age 16, women couldn’t enroll in college, so she proceeded to Troy Female Seminary instead. There she experienced preaching of hellfire and damnation to such a degree that she had a breakdown.

    <h3>What She Did After That</h3>
    
    <p>In 1839, Elizabeth stayed in Peterboro, New York, with her cousin Gerrit Smith—who later supported John Brown’s raid of an arsenal in Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia—and was introduced to the abolitionist movement. While there, she met Henry Brewster Stanton, a journalist and abolitionist volunteering for the American Anti-Slavery Society.
    <p>A well-educated woman, Elizabeth Cady Stanton Elizabeth married abolitionist lecturer Henry in 1840, but in a break with longstanding tradition, she insisted the word “obey” be dropped from her wedding vows. She, too, became active in the anti-slavery movement and worked alongside leading abolitionists of the day including Sarah and Angelina Grimke and William Lloyd Garrison, all guests at the Stanton home while they lived in Albany, New York and later Boston.
    <p>While on her honeymoon in London to attend a World’s Anti-Slavery convention, Elizabeth met abolitionist Lucretia Mott, who, like her, was also angry about the exclusion of women at the proceedings. Lucretia and Elizabeth, now fast friends, vowed to call a woman’s rights convention when they returned home. Eight years later, in 1848, Elizabeth and Lucretia held the first Woman’s Rights convention at Seneca Falls, New York. Elizabeth authored, “The Declaration of Sentiments,” which expanded on the Declaration of Independence by adding the word “woman” or “women” throughout. This pivotal document called for social and legal changes to elevate women’s place in society and listed 18 grievances from the inability to control their wages and property or the difficulty in gaining custody in divorce to the lack of the right to vote. That same year, Elizabeth circulated petitions throughout New York to urge the New York Congress to pass the New York Married Women’s Property Act.
    <p>Upon returning home, Henry studied law with Elizabeth’s father and became an attorney. The couple lived in Boston, Massachusetts, for a few years where Elizabeth heard the insights of prominent abolitionists. By 1848, they had three sons and moved to Seneca Falls, New York.
    <p>Elizabeth bore six children between 1842 and 1859 and had seven children total: Harriet Stanton Blach, Daniel Cady Stanton, Robert Livingston Stanton, Theodore Stanton, Henry Brewster Stanton, Jr., Margaret Livingston Stanton Lawrence and Gerrit Smith Stanton. During this time, she remained active in the fight for women’s rights, though the busyness of motherhood often limited her crusading to behind-the-scenes activities.
    <p>Then, in 1848, Elizabeth helped organize the First Women’s Rights Convention—often called the Seneca Falls Convention—with Lucretia Mott, Jane Hunt, Mary Ann M’Clintock and Martha Coffin Wright.
    <p>Although Elizabeth remained committed to efforts to gain property rights for married women and ending slavery, the women’s suffrage movement increasingly became her top priority. Elizabeth met Susan B. Anthony in 1851, and the two quickly began collaboration on speeches, articles, and books. Their intellectual and organizational partnership dominated the woman’s movement for over half a century. When Elizabeth was unable to travel do to the demands of raising her seven children, she would author speeches for Susan to deliver.

    <h3>The Speech She Gave</h3>
    
    <p> In 1868, Truth began a lecture tour that included a women’s rights conference in Akron, Ohio, where she delivered her famous “Ain’t I a Woman?” speech. In it, she challenged prevailing notions of racial and gender inferiority and inequality by reminding listeners of her combined strength (Truth was nearly six feet tall) and female status. Truth ultimately split with Douglass, who believed suffrage for formerly enslaved men should come before women’s suffrage; she thought both should occur simultaneously.— It goes like this.</p>
    
    <div id="speech">
    
    <p>I urge a sixteenth amendment, because 'manhood suffrage,' or a man's government, is civil, religious, and social disorganization. The male element is a destructive force, stern, selfish, aggrandizing, loving war, violence, conquest, acquisition, breeding in the material and moral world alike discord, disorder, disease, and death. See what a record of blood and cruelty the pages of history reveal! Through what slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice, through what inquisitions and imprisonments, pains and persecutions, black codes and gloomy creeds, the soul of humanity has struggled for the centuries, while mercy has veiled her face and all hearts have been dead alike to love and hope!

<p>The male element has held high carnival thus far; it has fairly run riot from the beginning, overpowering the feminine element everywhere, crushing out all the diviner qualities in human nature, until we know but little of true manhood and womanhood, of the latter comparatively nothing, for it has scarce been recognized as a power until within the last century. Society is but the reflection of man himself, untempered by woman's thought; the hard iron rule we feel alike in the church, the state, and the home. No one need wonder at the disorganization, at the fragmentary condition of everything, when we remember that man, who represents but half a complete being, with but half an idea on every subject, has undertaken the absolute control of all sublunary matters.

<p>People object to the demands of those whom they choose to call the strong-minded, because they say 'the right of suffrage will make the women masculine.' That is just the difficulty in which we are involved today. Though disfranchised, we have few women in the best sense; we have simply so many reflections, varieties, and dilutions of the masculine gender. The strong, natural characteristics of womanhood are repressed and ignored in dependence, for so long as man feeds woman she will try to please the giver and adapt herself to his condition. To keep a foothold in society, woman must be as near like man as possible, reflect his ideas, opinions, virtues, motives, prejudices, and vices. She must respect his statutes, though they strip her of every inalienable right, and conflict with that higher law written by the finger of God on her own soul.

<p>She must look at everything from its dollar-and-cent point of view, or she is a mere romancer. She must accept things as they are and make the best of them. To mourn over the miseries of others, the poverty of the poor, their hardships in jails, prisons, asylums, the horrors of war, cruelty, and brutality in every form, all this would be mere sentimentalizing. To protest against the intrigue, bribery, and corruption of public life, to desire that her sons might follow some business that did not involve lying, cheating, and a hard, grinding selfishness, would be arrant nonsense.

<p>In this way man has been molding woman to his ideas by direct and positive influences, while she, if not a negation, has used indirect means to control him, and in most cases developed the very characteristics both in him and herself that needed repression. And now man himself stands appalled at the results of his own excesses, and mourns in bitterness that falsehood, selfishness, and violence are the law of life. The need of this hour is not territory, gold mines, railroads, or specie payments but a new evangel of womanhood, to exalt purity, virtue, morality, true religion, to lift man up into the higher realms of thought and action.

<p>We ask woman's enfranchisement, as the first step toward the recognition of that essential element in government that can only secure the health, strength, and prosperity of the nation. Whatever is done to lift woman to her true position will help to usher in a new day of peace and perfection for the race.

<p>In speaking of the masculine element, I do not wish to be understood to say that all men are hard, selfish, and brutal, for many of the most beautiful spirits the world has known have been clothed with manhood; but I refer to those characteristics, though often marked in woman, that distinguish what is called the stronger sex. For example, the love of acquisition and conquest, the very pioneers of civilization, when expended on the earth, the sea, the elements, the riches and forces of nature, are powers of destruction when used to subjugate one man to another or to sacrifice nations to ambition.

<p>Here that great conservator of woman's love, if permitted to assert itself, as it naturally would in freedom against oppression, violence, and war, would hold all these destructive forces in check, for woman knows the cost of life better than man does, and not with her consent would one drop of blood ever be shed, one life sacrificed in vain.

<p>With violence and disturbance in the natural world, we see a constant effort to maintain an equilibrium of forces. Nature, like a loving mother, is ever trying to keep land and sea, mountain and valley, each in its place, to hush the angry winds and waves, balance the extremes of heat and cold, of rain and drought, that peace, harmony, and beauty may reign supreme. There is a striking analogy between matter and mind, and the present disorganization of society warns us that in the dethronement of woman we have let loose the elements of violence and ruin that she only has the power to curb. If the civilization of the age calls for an extension of the suffrage, surely a government of the most virtuous educated men and women would better represent the whole and protect the interests of all than could the representation of either sex alone.

    <h3>After That</h3>
    
    <p>Elizabeth helped write the Declaration of Sentiments, a document modeled after the Declaration of Independence that laid out what the rights of American women should be and compared the women’s rights struggle to the Founding Fathers’ fight for independence from the British.

    <p>The Declaration of Sentiments offered examples of how men oppressed women such as:

    <ul>
    <li>Preventing them from owning land or earning wages
    <li>Preventing them from voting
    <li>Compelling them to submit to laws created without their representation
    <li>Giving men authority in divorce and child custody proceedings and decisions
    <li>Preventing them from gaining a college education
    <li>Preventing them from participating in most public church affairs
    <li>Subjecting them to a different moral code than men
    <li>Aiming to make them dependent and submissive to men
    </ul>
Elizabeth read the Declaration of Sentiments at the convention and proposed women be given the right to vote, among other things. Sixty-eight women and 32 men signed the document—including prominent abolitionist Frederick Douglass—but many withdrew their support later when it came under public scrutiny.
    <p>By the 1880s, Elizabeth was 65 years old and focused more on writing rather than traveling and lecturing. She wrote three volumes of the History of Woman Suffrage (1881-85) with Susan(<a href="https://sarahobaird.github.io/Susan-B-Anthony/">read more about her here</a>) and Matilda Joslyn Gage. In this comprehensive work, published several decades before women won the right to vote, the authors documented the individual and local activism that built and sustained a movement for woman suffrage. Along with numerous articles on the subject of women and religion, Elizabeth published the Woman's Bible (1895, 1898), in which she voiced her belief in a secular state and urged women to recognize how religious orthodoxy and masculine theology obstructed their chances to achieve self-sovereignty. She also wrote an autobiography, Eighty Years and More, about the great events and work of her life. Elizabeth died in October 1902 in New York City, 18 years before women gained the right to vote.
    <p> In 1851, she met feminist Quaker and social reformer Susan B. Anthony. The two women could not have been more different, yet they became fast friends and co-campaigners for the temperance movement and then for the suffrage movement and for women’s rights. As a busy homemaker and mother, Elizabeth had much less time than the unmarried Susan to travel the lecture circuit, so instead she performed research and used her stirring writing talent to craft women’s rights literature and most of Susan’s speeches. Both women focused on women’s suffrage, but Elizabeth also pushed for equal rights for women overall.</p>
    <p>Her 1854 “Address to the Legislature of New York,” helped secure reforms passed in 1860 which allowed women to gain joint custody of their children after divorce, own property and participate in business transactions.
    <p>When the Civil War broke out, Elizabeth and Susan formed the Women’s Loyal National League to encourage Congress to pass the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery. In 1866, they lobbied against the 14th Amendment and 15th Amendment giving black men the right to vote because the amendments didn’t give the right to vote to women, too. Many of their abolitionist friends disagreed with their position, however, and felt that suffrage rights for black men was top priority.
    <p>In the late 1860s, Elizabeth began to advocate measures that women could take to avoid becoming pregnant. Her support for more liberal divorce laws, reproductive self-determination and greater sexual freedom for women made Elizabeth a somewhat marginalized voice among women reformers.
    
    <p>A rift soon developed within the suffrage movement. Elizabeth and Susan felt deceived and established the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, which focused on women’s suffrage efforts at the national level. A few months later some of their former abolitionist peers created the American Woman Suffrage Association, which focused on women’s suffrage at the state level.

    <p>By 1890, Susan managed to reunite the two associations into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) with Elizabeth at the helm. By 1896, four states had secured woman’s suffrage.
    <p>In the early 1880s, Elizabeth co-authored the first three volumes of the History of Woman Suffrage with Matilda Joslyn Gage and Susan B. Anthony. In 1895, she and a committee of women published The Woman’s Bible to point out the Bible’s bias towards women and challenge its stance that women should be submissive to men. The Woman’s Bible became a bestseller, but many of Elizabeth’s colleagues at the NAWSA were displeased with the irreverent book and formally censured her.

    <p>Though Elizabeth had lost some creditability, nothing would silence her passion for the women’s rights cause. Despite her declining health, she continued to fight for women’s suffrage and champion disenfranchised women. She published her autobiography, Eighty Years and More, in 1898.

        <h3>5 Quotes Said By Sojourner Truth</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>“We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal.”
            <li>"Come, come, my conservative friend, wipe the dew off your spectacles, and see that the world is moving.”
            <li>“We are the only class in history that has been left to fight its battles alone, unaided by the ruling powers. White labor and the freed black men had their champions, but where are ours?”
            <li>“The moment we begin to fear the opinions of others and hesitate to tell the truth that is in us, and from motives of policy are silent when we should speak, the divine floods of light and life no longer flow into our souls.”
            <li>“Truth is the only safe ground to stand on.”
